<h1 align="center">VSQL Version History</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>updated 210425</strong></p>

<hr>
<h4><em>Note: Version 4.2.3 is specific to Vassal Engine 3.2.17 [Java 8 update 
  91]; Version 4.3 is specific to Vassal engine 3.3+ (requiring Java 8. update 
  295 aka Java SDK 15]. The two versions are not compatible and are independent 
  in terms of capability.</em> <em>VSQL 4.3 is an Vassal Engine 3.3+ version of 
  VSQL. WGA is not attempting to keep changes in 4.2.# and 4.3.# in sync with 
  each other. [I cannot run Vassal Engine 3.3+ on my older systems, which are 
  used to create/develop/update the 50+ WGA vassal modules. </em></h4>
<h3>Version 4.2.3 (Scott Bramley, Pete Pollard, Bill Thomson) 210425</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Paul Blankenship's PBU LookAt capability assimilated. Similar to VASL from 
    which the code was extracted, CNTL-Right Click will temporarily draw a large 
    red circle on the map around the mouse location. This is used to draw opponent's 
    attention to the location being acted upon. This circle will appear both during 
    server play and any logfile. </li>
  <li>Removed Basic Counter Tray II.</li>
  <li>Renamed Basic Counter Tray from Tray from &#8216;Basic I&#8217; to &#8216;Basic&#8217;.</li>
  <li>Remove Marked Moved on Graveyard</li>
  <li>Removed blank help file.</li>
  <li>Updated version history. There was a gap between 4.1.7 and this version. 
  </li>
  <li>Removed the pseudo ASL Incremental IFT chart [IIFT]. This is not part of 
    any SQLS game nor matches the ASL IIFT [given lack of Pin Task Checks in SQLS]. 
    Believed to be a customized optional additions, it an the ASL IIFT can be 
    added as VSQL module extensions. </li>
  <li>Enabled the missing 'Change Vehicle ID' trait in the The Squad Leader STGIII(75) 
    and STGIII(105).</li>
  <li>Squad and crew unit ID label changed to blank replacing default of '1' or 
    'A'. Player can redefine by SHIFT-N. </li>
  <li>Return the counters to the original artwork 
    <ul>
      <li>Removed AE squad type identifier on GE 838.</li>
      <li>Changed the 'Cv' squad type identifier on GE 548 &amp; RU 537 to 'C'.</li>
      <li>Removed 'E' squad type identifier on GE 468.</li>
      <li>Removed 1 squad type identifier from GE 467. 1st line squad notation 
        used in GIA using GIA counter; exists in the CodGia module extension.</li>
      <li>Removed C squad type identifier from GE 436. </li>
      <li>Removed Cr crew type identifier from GE 248.</li>
      <li> Removed Cr squad type identifier from GE 247. </li>
      <li>Removed SS icon from all SS leaders, squads, leaders, and snipers.</li>
      <li>Removed Cr crew type identifier from AM 246.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Removed counters of unknown purpose/scenarios. (The images remain in the 
    module should they be needed later.) 
    <ul>
      <li>GE FJ 548 squad type identifier with GE (1)08 sub-units.</li>
      <li>GE 447 2nd line squad. They are introduced in GIA and exist in the CodGia 
        module extension.</li>
      <li>RU 448 squad.</li>
      <li>[RU 458 squad type retained as used in several WGA scenarios; represents 
        elite rifle squad introduced in ASL].</li>
      <li>[RU 9-0 and 10-0 Commissar counters retained as used in several WGA 
        scenarios; Commissars introduced in ASL].</li>
      <li>[Retained GE 447 counters utilized in selected WG SQL/COI scenarios; 
        GE 447 2nd line squad. They are introduced in GIA.]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Updated all the default squad letters of 'A' to &#8216;blank&#8217; for 
    all nationalities. [The Shift-N trait remains should player wish to letter 
    squads]. Some scenarios may require the owning player to secretly define which 
    squad possess a SW [in VSQL play denoted by creating a Delayed Note].</li>
  <li> Updated all the default crew numbers of '1' to &#8216;blank&#8217; for 
    all nationalities. [The Shift-N trait remains should player wish to letter 
    squads]. Some scenarios may require the owning player to secretly define which 
    squad possess a SW [in VSQL play denoted by creating a Delayed Note].</li>
  <li>Updated the default &#8216;Your Name Here&#8217; on Russian Armor Leaders. 
    Replaced with the same convention as German: TSgt, Lt., Cpt., Major, Col.</li>
  <li>Modified COI Horse counter to three sides, Normal [12 MP], Charging [18 
    MP] , and winded [6 MP].</li>
  <li>Added Sequence of Play [SOP] with tabs for SQL and COI. Accessed via SOP 
    button. </li>
  <li>PENDING: Remove all Wounded Leader counters [standard, berserk, heroic]. 
    Wounded leaders Is introduced I COD 122]. This trait will exist in the COD/GIA 
    v9.2 module extension. The wound icon will be added via trait rather than 
    a new set of wounded leaders for all nationalities. There is a wounded leader 
    in SQL WG1##, this is addressed in SSR.</li>
  <li> PENDING: Remove the &#8216;Wounded&#8217; trait on all sniper counters. 
    There is no wounded status for snipers in SQLS; ASL uses an completely different 
    mechanism for Snipers. </li>
  <li>DEBATING: Add Berserk superimposed sidebars trait to all infantry units 
    [SMC, MMC] similar to VASL. At present there are red counters for Russian 
    and SS units in SQL &amp; COI. However starting in COD, all units can go Berserk. 
    Red Counters for all nationalities is no longer distinct. Morale of Berserk 
    units is standardized in GIA independent of nationality. <br>
    DEBATING: Add Fanatic superimposed sidebars trait to all infantry units [SMC, 
    MMC] similar to VASL. At present fanatic units are a function of SSR and such 
    notation is a mental exercise based on location or usage of a Label trait. 
  </li>

    different vassal engine from that of its previous versions. VSQL 4 project 

    required to be repopulated and reprogrammed with all known features which 

    were developed up through version 3.30e. VSQL 4 project also required all 

    new counters to be created which enabled them to be used whether one was playing

<ul>

  <li> Added first five 'named' PLCs.</li>

  <li> Changed &quot;Can be invisible&quot; trait on most Info counters to have 

    the background color be white instead of transparent. Helps to see counters 

    better <br>

    on the board.</li>

  <li> Added SL and COI Quick Reference Cards to the Charts menu. Also added misc. 

    charts.</li>

  <li> Removed &quot;moved&quot; attribute from nearly all Info counters.</li>

  <li> Added &quot;CX&quot; option to each infantry unit. Now ctrl-X will place 

    a CX counter on that unit (similar functionality as the DM counter).</li>

  <li> Removed some reporting keys from counters that did not need it ('A' and 

    'S' were common ones).</li>

  <li> Changed menu system by pulling out the &quot;Basic&quot; menu and making 

    it its own top-level. Should make it easier for users to get to repeat counters 

    quickly.</li>

    water.</li>

  <li> Deleted &quot;does not move&quot; attribute from all pieces (via beta test 

    input). Replaced with &quot;marker/location&quot; for all of these counters. 

    Should help with <br>

    playability.</li>

  <li> Blank counters text labels have been center justified in all directions. 

    Text will now draw in the center of the counter vs. the top.</li>

  <li> Shortened many counter names per beta input. Should reduce the &quot;verbiage&quot; 

    that shows up on the info window during play. Along this line, abbreviated: 

    Partisan with 'p', Inexperienced with 'i'. SS names will remain with the 'ss' 

    suffix.</li>

  <li> Updated several &quot;info&quot; counters with the correct &quot;can be

    one that comes with VASSAL.</li>

  <li> Enabled the transparent stacking option in &quot;map window\stacking options\color

    so it does not appear on the Preferences menu. Currently, the flag in the 

    buildfile is not set. Rodney needs to work out a bug.</li>

  <li> Adjusted all MMC/SMC counters &quot;place marker&quot; attribute to have 

    the DM marker defined properly. Now the DM placed by these counters will function 

    the same as the DM on the Basic menu.</li>

  <li> Updated Prep/DF/AF counters per user input. Prep/AF are white. DF is gray. 

    Also changed counter layout for Prep to conform to template.</li>

  <li> Removed several redundant counters from the original COI game build. These 

    counters were when the vehicle rotation was previously defined as VCA #1 was 

    SE instead of NE</li>

  <li> Removed multiple obsolete counters not used from buildfile and images directory.</li>

  <li> Does Not Stack: Removed the &quot;DNS&quot; attribute from the following 

    counters. Substituted the Marker/Location attribute: Smoke, Fire (both), Rubble, 

    AR, Starshell, Aircraft (all)</li>

  <li> Added CE/Stun/+1TH/Withdraw to all vehicles. All vehicles can now button/unbutton 

    (ctrl-b), and cycle through the stun list if needed (ctrl-w).</li>

  <li> Compatibility exists backward to version 2.0. Future expansions will be 

    compatible with this module.</li>

  <li> Added COI counterset (provided by Dennis Jorgenson). New counterset does 

    not use the &quot;nationality&quot; functionality any more. This can be ignored 

    on the preferences menu (this menu will be removed in a future version).</li>

  <li> All vehicle/gun wrecks/malfunctions now rotate along all six directions.</li>

  <li> Added &quot;DM +2&quot; counter for SS units (similar functionality to 

    the American &quot;Can Route&quot; counter). DM+2 and &quot;Can Route&quot; 

    are flips of the basic DM counter.</li>

  <li> Added appropriate counters from the VASL 4.10 module which enhance VSQL. 

    (e.g. fanatic, No ammo/canister/etc, fortified building, etc.)</li>

  <li> Added &quot;Control&quot; counters to show side ownership / victory conditions.</li>

  <li> Added &quot;PLC&quot; menu (for future expansion)</li>

  <li> Moved Concealment counters to their own menu for each country.</li>

  <li> Separated SL and COI vehicles and guns into separate menus for each country 

    via tab.</li>

  <li> Added Draggable Overlays from VASL 4.10.</li>

  <li> Updated Charts for all modules, including COD and GI since they were available. 

    COD and GI functionality will be added at a later date.</li>

    gameplay.</li>

  <li> Changed the Defensive Fire counter to a gray background to facilitate easy 

    spotting.</li>

  <li> Added help menus, credits, etc. to the &quot;help&quot; tab.</li>

  <li> All vehicles now will remain as &quot;hindrances&quot; when checking LOS 

    (if that option is chosen on the preferences menu. Now you will be able to 

    see if the LOS thread crosses the vehicle silhouette.</li>

  <li> Counters like the &quot;level&quot; counter added the Marker attribute 

    with the &quot;Location&quot; flag to allow units to stack both above or below 

    the counter. Moving units through this type of counter will no longer drag 

    the counter with the stack. To move these special counters if the counter 

    if it is part of a stack, expand the stack then drag the counter out.</li>

  <li> Reorganized attributes on all counters to make them consistent. </li>

  <li>Reorganized menus to make them fit the new counterset.</li>

  <li> Revamped module to include latest VASSAL improvements.</li>

  <li> Updated .class code to be consistent with the VASL series.</li>

  <li> Added &quot;template&quot; text file to the beta-distribution package.
