2.0.14-beta – 7/14/03 -- Jay Yanek & Dennis Jorgenson
? Fixed “remove counters” bug.  DF and AF counters were not removing because they were 
renamed.
? Fixed –1 acq (all four counters) where the counter was not flipping.  Layer was not active.
? Removed “moved” attribute from nearly all Info counters.
? Fixed large mortar covered arc.  They were 180 degrees out of phase.
? Added “CX” option to each infantry unit.  Now ctrl-X will place a CX counter on that unit 
(similar functionality as the DM counter).
? Removed some reporting keys from counters that did not need it (‘A’ and ‘S’ were common 
ones).
? Changed menu system by pulling out the “Basic” menu and making it its own top-level. 
Should make it easier for users to get to repeat counters quickly.
? Fixed the Russian 537.  The flipped side was showing “berserk”.

2.0.13-beta -- 7/11/03 -- Jay Yanek & Dennis Jorgenson

? Added “hero” counter (under PLC menu).
? Added “berserk” counters to Russian and SS armor leaders/CE.
? Updated turret counters to new graphics.
? Added overlays for grain, marsh, rubble (stone & wood), woods, and water.
? Deleted “does not move” attribute from all pieces (via beta test input).  Replaced with 
“marker/location” for all of these counters.  Should help with playability.
? Blank counters text labels have been center justified in all directions.  Text will now draw in 
the center of the counter vs. the top.
? Fixed name of German CE 9-2 SS (was labeled as 9-1)
? Shortened many counter names per beta input.  Should reduce the “verbage” that shows up 
on the info window during play.  Along this line, abbreviated:  Partisan with ‘p’, 
Inexperienced with ‘i’.  SS names will remain with the ‘ss’ suffix.
? Updated several “info” counters with the correct “can be marked moved” attribute.  
VASL/VSQL uses a custom attribute, not the standard one that comes with VASSAL.

2.0.12-beta -- 7/9/03 -- Jay Yanek & Dennis Jorgenson

front side.  Removed text and removed suffix setting.
? Added level name to several Info counters so that when the counter is moved/changed, it 
shows the appropriate layer name in the chat window.
? Enabled the transparent stacking option in “map window\stacking options\color of pieces 
when not expanded”.  Set transparent per instructions.  Now when pieces are stacked and not 
expanded, you can see portions of the lower pieces.
? Back added the “overview” window “map window\overview window”.  Was originally taken 
out to help faster module building.

Kinney).  This .class will allow us to toggle the Nationality function so it does not appear on

out a bug.
? Removed “ASL” from the Roadblock counter.
? Fixed American M3 MG (SL vehicle).  It was showing wrecked only.
? Removed “does not stack” from track counter.  Was dropping counter to bottom of a stack!

menu will be removed in a future version).

? Added “DM +2” counter for SS units (similar functionality to the American “Can Route”

silhouette.
? Appropriate counters have “can not be moved” attribute.  To drag those counters, shift-click.
? Counters like the “level” counter added the Marker attribute with the “Location” flag to 
allow units to stack both above or below the counter.  Moving units through this type of 
counter will no longer drag the counter with the stack.  To move these special counters if the 
counter if it is part of a stack, expand the stack then drag the counter out.
