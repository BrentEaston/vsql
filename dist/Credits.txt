VASL and the VASSAL engine were written by Rodney Kinney (vasl@vasl.org), but
they are far from the work of one man. New counter artwork in version 5 was
contributed by Kenn Monte, Ken Knudsen, Jeff Leslie, Eric Givler, and Zoltan Grose. Counter
redesign was done by Jeffrey Malter. Tom Repetti contributed map work, terrain
design, and overall moral support. David Sullivan has allowed use of his Java
libraries for computing LOS. David Lake (www.lakewebworks.com) designed the VASL
web site. Thanks to counter trolls Klaus Fischer, Scott Brady, Sam Tyson, Brad
Hampson, and Carl Fung. Thanks to map gnomes Tim Fachko, Gordon Molek, Carl
Pfeiffer, and Bruce Mansfield. Thanks to Gary Krockover for the TurnPhase
indicator, and to Ole Bøe for permission to use his IIFT(M)QRDC.

Finally, thanks to Multi-Man Publishing for their selfless support
of the ASL hobby, and their continued indulgence of VASL.
