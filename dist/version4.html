<h1>VSQL
</h1><blockquote><h2>01) Stack Angle
</h2><blockquote><p> Change stack angle so that you can move selected portions of a  spread stack to the hex directly "above" the current stack. (AY/BE)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>02) Add "fired" submenu to combat units
</h2><blockquote><p>Add "fired" submenu to all units, with Prep/def/advancing fire options. (BE)</p><p> * Maybe limit to infantry units and vehicles with weapons? (once you create the counter you can easile move it around in the stack)</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>03) Fix LOS problems and items that are ASL (not SL/etc) definitions
</h2><blockquote><p>* Gully treatment (SLList)</p><p>* Cliffs need to be by hexside, not the image as now (AY)</p><p>* On some boards terrain extends past a hexside, this erroneous extension should NOT block an LOS (AY)</p><p>* identify others!</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>04) Report BU/CE status change for vehicles
</h2><blockquote><p>(AY)</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>05) Movement Trail problem
</h2><blockquote><p>Trail Report Problem when moving ldr/sqd out of larger stack (AY)</p><p>   See notes and example in "34_SL3_GT5beg.log"</p><p> [Basically, if you have a large stack from which you pull ldr/squad, the "trail" function won't report a "2" in the first hex moved, but only in the second and subsequent hexes.]</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>06) Charts window to background
</h2><blockquote><p>Charts window will not go to the background, is either primary or  closed (multiple-window preference choice only?) (AY)</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>07) Entrenchments don't need "moved" characteristic
</h2><blockquote><p> (AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>08) Improve Smoke counter visibility
</h2><blockquote><p>SMOKE: The Problem is it is hard to see the SMOKE (especially under  vehicles) and not possible to verify terrain in the smoke hex, even by  using the LOS option. (AY, SB, BT, JY, and others)</p><p>  * perhaps make smoke into hex-shape counters?</p><p>  * perhaps lighten smoke background so you can see the underlying board terrain?</p><p>  * perhaps turn smoke 45 degrees to increase visibility?</p><p>  *perhaps have smoke NOT retained (or lightened?) in LOS function</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Created Hex shaped Smoke counters</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>09) SMOKE: Stacking
</h2><blockquote><p>SMOKE: Since it is possible to place multiple smokes in one hex, is  there a way to show this on the map without having to check the mouse-over display? Possible for them to visibly stack? (AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Moved Smoke to new 'Terrain' layer and allow it to stack</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>10) Hex shaped Terrain counters
</h2><blockquote><p>Full-hex characteristics:  Since smoke, fire, and rubble make the ENTIRE hex into that terrain/characteristic, can these be hex-shaped/sized markers?</p><p> [This would really help in the scenarios w/river-edge mist, like SL#11.] (AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>11) Scrollable Overview window
</h2><blockquote><p>On the map, you can not scroll the "overview" window, making it useless in the cases that you'd like to use it (in big scenarios, like SL#11). (AY)</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>12) SL 105art does not rotate on malfunction side
</h2><blockquote><p>(AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>13) Change Initial Map Zoom and Add Documentation
</h2><blockquote><p>Should have a preference setting for WHICH of the seven map sizes should be the default when loading a scenario save/log file. If not possible, have VSQL load at the _middle_ size setting. (AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Set initial zoom to 4</p><p> </p><p>Default map size:  Any way we can make the default map size and zoom increments configurable in the preferences?  I know *I* can do this for my personal copy by tweaking the module code, which I probably will, but didn't know if it could be a convenient preference. (JY)</p><p> </p><p>Full zoom in/out:  Can we have a button on the map window that will fully zoom in (or out) without having to step through each one? (JY)</p><p></p><p>Beta 3 - Set initial zoom to 3</p><p></p><p>Add Extra documentation on what it all means</p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>14) Improve Turn Record
</h2><blockquote><p>Turn Record:  If possible, move this function to the end of the menu at the top of the map, continue reporting changes to the value. (AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Removed old Turn counter. Added Turn Tracker</p><p> </p><p> (JY) Turn counter.  Starts axis then allied.  Sometimes Allied goes first hough ...</p><p> </p><p> (BE) Right-click on the Turn counter window and select 'Configure' (?) I think it is? 'Set' allows you to change directly to any turn.</p><p> </p><p> (AY) Perhaps a more verbose description in the mouse-over?</p><p></p><p>Bete 3 - Added Mouse-over description 'Right-click to configure'</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>15) Turn Record format
</h2><blockquote><p>Turn record:  Change reporting from "# - Axis" to "Axis - #" (by putting the Axis/Allies label ABOVE the number value in the field.  If possible use  "turn" instead of a dash. (AY)</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Added Turn Tracker </p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>16) Add OBA Module to Info
</h2><blockquote><p> Info Page:  Add OBA module information (in the currecnt turn space) (AY)</p><p>  * Space for listing module calibre, identified by Axis/Allied.  Pull-down menu would be great but a fillable field (three characters wide) would work along with an Axis/Allied indicator.  Probably need about four sets of fields.</p><p>  * Have OBA information carry over into "private notes" section, but have the private notes page include a field for entering mission information.</p><p></p><p>DONE</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>17) Disable Save Game when log file active
</h2><blockquote><p>When writing to a logfile, can the "save game" option be non-selectable? This would save a lot of beginners from bad mistakes. (AY)</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>18) AFV presentation fixes
</h2><blockquote><p>AFV presentation fixes (all for COI?): (AY)</p><p>  * there should be a way for all markers (malfunction, etc) to automatically travel with the vehicle, perhaps by putting these into the vehicle menu?</p><p>  * the (GI) method of using a turret image for CE was not an improvement and should not be used.  Instead, use either the COI "CE" counter or the one now used on SL vehicles.  [Keep it separate from the turret.]</p><p>  * When a tank is fliped to become a wreck, remove all extra characteristics (turret, CE, malfunctions, abandoned ...)</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>19) Report change in Hidden Status
</h2><blockquote><p>Make the removal of "hidden status" report on the chat dialogue.  Perhaps "?" -> "9-1" (for example).</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>20) American Leaders require standard DM marker
</h2><blockquote><p>American leaders: (AY)</p><p> Currently generates the "non-DM" marker when flipped, need to return the  characteristic of the _regular_ DM marker like in the older versions.</p><p> </p><p> Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>21) Cleared layer for Mine counters
</h2><blockquote><p>MINE Counters: (AY)</p><p>Can we add a "cleared" option on this counter, perhaps the "minen" image with an international red circle and slash?  Need for both AP and AT mines.</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>22) Move Rubble & Fire counters in menu
</h2><blockquote><p>In the Counters/Info tab:Locations/terrain; please put the "rubble", "fire" and "building fire" at the top of the listing.  These are the ones that are used the most during play. (AY)</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>23) Move CE counter on Menu
</h2><blockquote><p>In counters/Info:Vehicular; put the "CE" first, preferably with the white counter the first one up.  These get a lot of use with HTs and their passengers.</p><p>In fact, it would be nice to have a white "BU" option too ... since sometimes there are passengers in one HT, some CE and some not. (AY)</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>24) Blank Counter labels
</h2><blockquote><p>Blank counters.  In the earlier VASL, when you added a label to a blank counter (small/large with a nationality, white, OR clear/user-labeled), the  label was centered on the counter, instead of being on the top.  Could this  characteristic be returned? (AY)</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>25) Split hex problem
</h2><blockquote><p>Problem with whole hexes that are split between two boards.half hexes. SL "standard" reporting system is to report location using the lower numbered board.  (JY, and many others)</p><p></p><p>DONE</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>26) Preference Folder for File/Load game
</h2><blockquote><p>Preference Folder for File/Load game: (JY)</p><p>This would be real helpful (AY).  On my machine it goes to whatever folder  I've used most recently for a load or save ... means a lot of selecting when  you do other things on your computer, too.  BTW, it _does_ a good job of remembering your last load value ... makes it real easy to slightly rename a file when you do your own email log.  Please RETAIN that feature!</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>27) Range in non-verbose LOS
</h2><blockquote><p>Range counting in the LOS checker: (JY)</p><p>Have the LOS checker report range even if not in verbose mode. AY: I'd like  that, I don't use verbose mode, but counting the range would be real helpful!</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>28) Internet Dice to Extension
</h2><blockquote><p>Internet Dice server as an extension module: (JY)</p><p>Anything to make this easier to modify would be good.</p><p></p><p>Beta 4 - Moved to extension and added Account Name/Password</p><p></p><p>Messages are not printing properly in chat window.</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>29) Additional SSR options
</h2><blockquote><p>Wishful thinking: (AY) This is probably beyond VSQL but, can terrain  features like orchards, shellholes, hedges, walls ... be transformable in the terrain SSR options?  Particularly for their removal from the maps?</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>30) Night Shading
</h2><blockquote><p>Night Shading on Boards (BE)</p><p></p><p>Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>31) Add user name to chat reports
</h2><blockquote><p>Include the username of the player that performs each action in the Chat Window</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>32) Add Last Move Highlighter
</h2><blockquote><p>Highlight last counter moved by opponent. Standard feature from vassal 2.6</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>33) Add Public Notes and Delayed Notes
</h2><blockquote><p>Rename existing public notes to Scenario notes. Add new Public notes. Add Delayed notes (standard vassal 2.6 feature).</p><p> </p><p>Beta 1 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>34) New Counter Detail Viewer
</h2><blockquote><p>Rewrote counter detail viewer for VSQL, now included in vassal 2.6. Show counters from all layers including terrain. </p><p> </p><p>Beta 1- Included</p><p> </p><p>(JY) Brent -- If you put a label on a counter, and then mouse-over the counter to see the "big" counter, it does not show the lable.  Doh!  Any way to help here?  Sometimes the label does get in the way.  But now the only way to see the label is to manually zoom the board all the way in.</p><p></p><p>(BE) Viewer is showing all counters double!</p><p>(BE) Double problemFixed with Vassal 2.6.4.  Beta 3 shows labels.</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>35) No Issue 35
</h2><blockquote><p>(!)</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>36) Game Piece Layers & Counter visibility issues
</h2><blockquote><p>Implement Game Piece Layers. </p><p>Counters within their individual layers will stack with themselves, but not with the other layer.</p><p></p><p>Two layers used:</p><p>1. Terrain - For counters that will never have any units underneath them. Smoke, Fire, Building Fire, Rubble, Ford, Wire, Roadblock, Fortified Building.</p><p>2. Ground - All other units and markers.</p><p></p><p>New LOS option to show all counters on board as semi-transparent instead of dissapearing.</p><p></p><p>Beta 1 - Included. Needs refinement.</p><p></p><p>(JY) I like it, sort-of.  Problem:  If an infantry is riding a vehicle, you cannot see the vehicle outline.  This may cause problems with LOS issues.</p><p></p><p>(BE) Yes, there are some issues there, I haven't had much of chance to play. Also, if you have a stack of units, the transparency sums, so you end up with the stack being opaque. </p><p></p><p>The hide all units button (see below) will fix the opaque stack issue, but not the passanger issue as we want to hide the infantry, but not the vehicle.</p><p></p><p>Will have a to think about this. Sometimes you want to see where the infantry is when doing a LOS of check so you know you are checking the correct hex. Sometimes you don't want to see them. I'll have a think about this. May need some extra control to turn the infantry display on/off while doing LOS checks. Might be able to do a 'Hide Infantry' button that you can use while doing LOS checks.</p><p></p><p>(AY) Moving most units off of the semi-transparency ought to make this lessnecessary, IMO.</p><p></p><p> Why not JUST leave vehicles and HEX-shaped counters on the map in semi-transparency.  That should be all that is really needed.  {note that for LOS/shot determination it really helps to have the smoke there, so you can tell for certain if you need to include that modifier.  Rubble and fire also affect LOS by changing the terrain to full-hex, like smoke.</p><p></p><p>Please leave bridges and roadblocks in semi-transparency (or even full display?).  They can affect LOS determinations.</p><p></p><p>(BE) I started down the this track because sometimes, I find it incredibly annoying that you can't see the infantry when doing a LOS check. I 'forget' where the units are and have to keep flicking in and out LOS mode and having to redraw the LOS thread. Maybe it doesn't bother bother other people as much.</p><p></p><p>How about the default action of the LOS thread is All units except 'hindrance' counters invisible. All 'Hindrance' counters visible, but semi-transparent. More or less the same as the old version, except you will be able to see underneath the counters left on the board. We add some key combination that will temporarily show all non-hindrance counters semi-transparent also.</p><p></p><p>Hindrance counters are:</p><p></p><p> - All Vehicles</p><p> - Smoke</p><p> - Rubble</p><p> - Building Fire</p><p> - Fire</p><p> - Bridge</p><p> - Roadblock</p><p> - Any others?</p><p></p><p>(JY) The "V" counters ... Although they do not move with stacks, they seem to stack.  Sometimes on top, sometimes on bottom.  Can we get them always on the bottom?  They should go ABOVE terrain modifications, but BELOW infantry/vehicles IMHO.</p><p></p><p>(JY) Brent -- Bill and I had an issue with overlays in 4.0b1.  They seemed to be ABOVE the infantry counters such that if you moved a counter onto theoverlay, it disappeared!  When you moved the overlay, the counters were there.  Wrong layer?  Maybe it is the new world order physics model ...Where trees float!  That certainly helps in "seeing the forest through the trees" (ha ha)</p><p></p><p>(BE) I'm thinking we need the following layers</p><p></p><p>1. Overlay: Bottom level Terrain pieces that MUST go on the bottom</p><p>2. Terrain: Smoke, Rubble etc. that behaves like terrain, but has to appear on top of overlays.</p><p>3. Control: Markers that appear on top of terrain and overlay's, but always under all other counters. VP counters and perhaps the Control counters?</p><p>4. Ground: Everything else that stacks up on top</p><p></p><p>Beta 2 - Adjusted layers</p><p></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>37) Sewer Lost counter text
</h2><blockquote><p>Under Info/locations ... the "sewer lost" counter says "lost: 6" this must be an ASL rule, in SL/etc, folks get lost on a 5/6.</p><p>Any easy way to fix this? (AY)</p><p></p><p>Beta 3 - Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>38) Add Scenario Refresh Button
</h2><blockquote><p>Add a 'Refresh' button that updates current game by replacing all counters with latest versions from the palette (BE)</p><p></p><p>Beta 2 - Added</p><p></p><p>(JY) Refresh "seemed" to work (still checking it over), with one exception I noted.</p><p>I had an american stack with a "May Route" counter on top.  When I "refreshed", it replaced it with a normal "DM" counter.</p><p></p><p>(BE) Problem is the May Rout counter is named DM, Refresh gets confused. </p><p></p><p>Beta 3 - Renamed May Rout counter from DM to May Rout. Updated Remove All menu to cope. Fixed bug where markers where losing values, causing strange stacking problems.</p><p></p><p> - Concealment counters: need to update somehow - add level marker if not already present</p><p> - Problems upgrading old DM markers. May Routs?</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>39) Counter Inventory Function
</h2><blockquote><p>Save game as text button to have option to produce a more useful summary of counters (BT)</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>40) Counter Graveyard
</h2><blockquote><p>Add Graveyard window and 'Send to Graveyard' option to all applicable counters (BT)</p><p></p><p>DONE</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>41) Upgrade launch bar button icons
</h2><blockquote><p>Use WGA set - consistent size accross window.</p><p></p><p>Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>42) Re-organise Launch Bar
</h2><blockquote><p>Vassal 2.6 has option to stack any launch buttons up into launch button menus.</p><p></p><p>Done</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>43) Add 1d4 button
</h2><blockquote><p>Perhaps as part of launch bar tidy up. Leave 2d6 as separate button, add Dice menu button with 1d4, 1d6 and Internet Dice.</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>44) Bring back the Poodles
</h2><blockquote><p>Oh, no, my Panzer Poodle and Poodle Paratrooper are gone!  *sniff*. (JY)</p><p></p><p>Poodles are in the PLC extension (BME).</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>45) Add Hide/Show All Units button
</h2><blockquote><p>Standard vassal button to make all units on board vanish.</p><p></p><p>Removed & integrated with F10 LOS button</p><p></p><p>DONE</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>46) Generate rolls in Delayed Notes
</h2><blockquote><p>(AY)  if it was possible to do a 1d4 roll and place the result into the delayed info window ... this would be absolutely great.  No need for the results to go to the regular chat line, since these are always "chit draws" and reflect either OBA missions or victory draws.  Is this possible? Something like entering a description and then doing a "roll" with the result going into the delay info?</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>47) Clone and Delete keys
</h2><blockquote><p>Remove Clone Key from combat units</p><p>Hide Delete key on combat units except when in graveyard</p><p></p><p>DONE</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>48) Report board and overlay names when loading saved game.
</h2><blockquote><p>Included in beta 5</p><p></p><p>Fixed in beta 6 - just report successful overlay names when </p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>49) Add Sewer entrance overlay
</h2><blockquote><p>DONE</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>50) Vehicle ID
</h2><blockquote><p>Label in top left corner on top of counter</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><h2>51) Add extra divider (s?) to Remove All Menu
</h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2>52) Add documentation
</h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2>53) Gray out Snap to Grid button when Enable LOS selected
</h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2>54) Move Rules Level from Preference to Scenario Notes Window
</h2><blockquote><p>Move to 'Zoom' tab and rename 'Preferences'.</p><p>Move OBA to Preferences also.</p><p>Default Chart selection to Rules Level.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
