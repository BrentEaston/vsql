Items for VSQLv3/0/1 maintanebce update consideration
(problems to fix and player wish list)

NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER!  Items as of 2/16/2006.

1) Change stack angle so that you can move selected portions of a 
spread stack to the hex directly "above" the current stack. (AY/BE)

2) Add "fired" submenu to all units, with Prep/def/advancing fire
options. (BE)
-- Maybe limit to infantry units and vehicles with weapons?
(once you create the counter you can easile move it around in the stack)

3) Fix LOS problems and items that are ASL (not SL/etc) definitions
-- Gully treatment (SLList)
-- Cliffs need to be by hexside, not the image as now (AY)
-- On some boards terrain extends past a hexside, this erroneous
extension should NOT block an LOS (AY)
-- identify others!

4) Report BU/CE status change for vehicles (AY)

5) Trail Report Problem when moving ldr/sqd out of larger stack (AY)
  See notes and example in "34_SL3_GT5beg.log"
[Basically, if you have a large stack from which you pull ldr/squad,
the "trail" function won't report a "2" in the first hex moved, but
only in the second and subsequent hexes.]

6) Charts window will not go to the background, is either primary or 
closed (multiple-window preference choice only?) (AY)

7) Entrenchments don't need "moved" characteristic (AY)

8) SMOKE: The Problem is it is hard to see the SMOKE (especially under 
vehicles) and not possible to verify terrain in the smoke hex, even by 
using the LOS option. (AY, SB, BT, JY, and others)
-- perhaps make smoke into hex-shape counters?
-- perhaps lighten smoke background so you can see the underlying board
terrain?
-- perhaps turn smoke 45 degrees to increase visibility?
-- perhaps have smoke NOT retained (or lightened?) in LOS function

9) SMOKE: Since it is possible to place multiple smokes in one hex, is 
there a way to show this on the map without having to check the mouse-over
display? Possible for them to visibly stack? (AY)

10) Full-hex characteristics:  Since smoke, fire, and rubble make the ENTIRE
hex into that terrain/characteristic, can these be hex-shaped/sized markers?
[This would really help in the scenarios w/river-edge mist, like SL#11.] (AY)

11) On the map, you can not scroll the "overview" window, making it useless
in the cases that you'd like to use it (in big scenarios, like SL#11). (AY)
-- If not possible to implement a scroll function, perhaps remove function?

12) SL 105art does not rotate on malfunction side (AY)

13) Should have a preference setting for WHICH of the seven map sizes should
be the default when loading a scenario save/log file. If not possible, have
VSQL load at the _middle_ size setting. (AY)

14) Turn Record:  If possible, move this function to the end of the menu at
the top of the map, continue reporting changes to the value. (AY)

15) Turn record:  Change reporting from "# - Axis" to "Axis - #" (by putting
the Axis/Allies label ABOVE the number value in the field.  If possible use 
"turn" instead of a dash. (AY)

16) Info Page:  Add OBA module information (in the currecnt turn space) (AY)
-- Space for listing module calibre, identified by Axis/Allied.  Pull-down
menu would be great but a fillable field (three characters wide) would work
along with an Axis/Allied indicator.  Probably need about four sets of fields.
-- Have OBA information carry over into "private notes" section, but have
the private notes page include a field for entering mission information.

17) When writing to a logfile, can the "save game" option be non-selectable?
This would save a lot of beginners from bad mistakes. (AY)

18) AFV presentation fixes (all for COI?): (AY)
-- there should be a way for all markers (malfunction, etc) to automatically
travel with the vehicle, perhaps by putting these into the vehicle menu?
-- the (GI) method of using a turret image for CE was not an improvement and
should not be used.  Instead, use either the COI "CE" counter or the one now
used on SL vehicles.  [Keep it separate from the turret.]
-- When a tank is fliped to become a wreck, remove all extra characteristics
(turret, CE, malfunctions, abandoned ...)

19) Make the removal of "hidden status" report on the chat dialogue.
Perhaps "?" -> "9-1" (for example).

20) American leaders: (AY)
Currently generates the "non-DM" marker when flipped, need to return the 
characteristic of the _regular_ DM marker like in the older versions.

21) MINE Counters: (AY)
Can we add a "cleared" option on this counter, perhaps the "minen" image with
an international red circle and slash?  Need for both AP and AT mines.

22) In the Counters/Info tab:Locations/terrain; please put the "rubble", "fire"
and "building fire" at the top of the listing.  These are the ones that are used
the most during play. (AY)

23) In counters/Info:Vehicular; put the "CE" first, preferably with the white
counter the first one up.  These get a lot of use with HTs and their passengers.
In fact, it would be nice to have a white "BU" option too ... since sometimes
there are passengers in one HT, some CE and some not. (AY)

24) Blank counters.  In the earlier VASL, when you added a label to a blank
counter (small/large with a nationality, white, OR clear/user-labeled), the 
label was centered on the counter, instead of being on the top.  Could this 
characteristic be returned? (AY)

25) Problem with whole hexes that are split between two boards.half hexes.
SL "standard" reporting system is to report location using the lower numbered
board.  (JY, and many others)

26) Preference Folder for File/Load game: (JY)
This would be real helpful (AY).  On my machine it goes to whatever folder 
I've used most recently for a load or save ... means a lot of selecting when 
you do other things on your computer, too.  BTW, it _does_ a good job of
remembering your last load value ... makes it real easy to slightly rename
a file when you do your own email log.  Please RETAIN that feature!

27) Range counting in the LOS checker: (JY)
Have the LOS checker report range even if not in verbose mode. AY: I'd like 
that, I don't use verbose mode, but counting the range would be real helpful!

28) Internet Dice server as an extension module: (JY)
Anything to make this easier to modify would be good.

29) Wishful thinking: (AY) This is probably beyond VSQL but, can terrain 
features like orchards, shellholes, hedges, walls ... be transformable in
the terrain SSR options?  Particularly for their removal from the maps?
