4.0 02/15/09 (Bill Sosnicki)
-- Brent Easton provided the main core of VSQL 4 project, which utilizes a different vassal engine from that of its previous versions.  VSQL 4 project required to be repopulated and reprogrammed with all known features which were developed up through version 3.30e.   VSQL 4 project also required all new counters to be created which enabled them to be used whether one was playing under COI or GIA enviroments.  This allowed the program to maintain a smaller file size.

-- Fixed reporting of movement of HIP unit. Now reported as '* ? Moves ? -> ?'

   certain extra ? counters are indistinguishable from ordinary counters. Re-organised
   order of traits in all counters. Removed Clone and Delete from BasicPiece to separate
   traits. Major traits added via prototypes.
-- Removed all Colored Background traits and set Invisible background color correctly.

background color be white instead of transparent.  Helps to see counters better 
on the board.
-- Added SL and COI Quick Reference Cards to the Charts menu.  Also added 
misc. charts.
-- Removed "moved" attribute from nearly all Info counters.
-- Added "CX" option to each infantry unit.  Now ctrl-X will place a CX counter 
on that unit (similar functionality as the DM counter).
-- Removed some reporting keys from counters that did not need it ('A' and 'S' 
were common ones).

top-level. Should make it easier for users to get to repeat counters quickly.

-- Updated turret counters to new graphics.
-- Added overlays for grain, marsh, rubble (stone & wood), woods, and water.

Replaced with "marker/location" for all of these counters.  Should help with 
playability.
-- Blank counters text labels have been center justified in all directions.  Text 
will now draw in the center of the counter vs. the top.
-- Shortened many counter names per beta input.  Should reduce the "verbage" 
that shows up on the info window during play.  Along this line, abbreviated:  
Partisan with 'p', Inexperienced with 'i'.  SS names will remain with the 'ss' 
suffix.
-- Updated several "info" counters with the correct "can be marked moved" 
attribute.  VASL/VSQL uses a custom attribute, not the standard one that 
comes with VASSAL.
-- Enabled the transparent stacking option in "map window\stacking 
options\color of pieces when not expanded".  Set transparent per instructions.  
Now when pieces are stacked and not expanded, you can see portions of the 
lower pieces.
-- Updated American, German, Russian FFE counters.  Left the Blue/Red OBA 
counters in the set for now.
-- Added new ASLCommandEncoder.class file to the \VASL\build\module 
section (via Rodney Kinney).  This .class will allow us to toggle the 
Nationality function so it does not appear on the Preferences menu.  Currently, 
the flag in the buildfile is not set.  Rodney needs to work out a bug.
-- Adjusted all MMC/SMC counters "place marker" attribute to have the DM 
marker defined properly.  Now the DM placed by these counters will function 
the same as the DM on the Basic menu.
-- Added 2.0.3 American AT counters to images file for compatibility.
-- Updated Prep/DF/AF counters per user input.  Prep/AF are white.  DF is gray.  
Also changed counter layout for Prep to conform to template.
-- Removed several redundant counters from the original COI game build.  
These counters were when the vehicle rotation was previously defined as 
VCA #1 was SE instead of NE.
-- Removed multiple obsolete counters not used from buildfile and images 
directory.
-- Does Not Stack:  Removed the "DNS" attribute from the following counters.  
Substituted the Marker/Location attribute:  Smoke, Fire (both), Rubble, AR, 
Starshell, Aircraft (all).
-- Added CE/Stun/+1TH/Withdraw to all vehicles.  All vehicles can now 
button/unbutton (ctrl-b), and cycle through the stun list if needed (ctrl-w).
-- Compatibility exists backward to version 2.0.  Future expansions will be 
compatible with this module.
-- Added COI counterset (provided by Dennis Jorgenson).  New counterset does 
not use the "nationality" functionality any more.  This can be ignored on the 
preferences menu (this menu will be removed in a future version).
-- All vehicle/gun wrecks/malfunctions now rotate along all six directions.
-- Added "DM +2" counter for SS units (similar functionality to the American 
"Can Route" counter).  DM+2 and "Can Route" are flips of the basic DM 
counter.
-- Added appropriate counters from the VASL 4.10 module which enhance 
VSQL.  (e.g.  fanatic, No ammo/cannister/etc, fortified building, etc.)
-- Added "Control" counters to show side ownership / victory conditions.
-- Added "PLC" menu (for future expansion)
-- Moved Concealment counters to their own menu for each country.
-- Separated SL and COI  vehicles and guns into separate menus for each 
country via tab.
-- Added Draggable Overlays from VASL 4.10.

available.  COD and GI functionality will be added at a later date.
-- Changed the "Remove" menu on the Map window to better reflect gameplay.
-- Changed the Defensive Fire counter to a gray background to facilitate easy 
spotting.
-- Added help menus, credits, etc. to the "help" tab.
-- All vehicles now will remain as "hindrances" when checking LOS (if that 
option is chosen on the preferences menu.  Now you will be able to see if the 
LOS thread crosses the vehicle silhouette.
-- Counters like the "level" counter added the Marker attribute with the 
"Location" flag to allow units to stack both above or below the counter.  
Moving units through this type of counter will no longer drag the counter with 
the stack.  To move these special counters if the counter if it is part of a stack, 
expand the stack then drag the counter out.
-- Reorganized attributes on all counters to make them consistent.
-- Reorganized menus to make them fit the new counterset.
-- Revamped module to include latest VASSAL improvements.
-- Updated .class code to be consistent with the VASL series.
-- Added "template" text file to the beta-distribution package.  To be used so 
future authors can understand how various genres of pieces are built.
