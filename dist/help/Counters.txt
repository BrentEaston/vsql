	Add counters by dragging them from the toolbar at the top of
the map.

	Right-click to expand a stack in order to view its contents.
(Mac users hold down the apple key.)  Right-click again to return it
to compacted form.

	Click and drag stacks to move them, or individual counters
from an expanded stack.  Shift-click to select multiple counters to move.

	Click on a counter to select it.  (It will be drawn with a thick
black border.)   Then use these commands to alter the counter:

right-arrow	move upward one position in the stack
left-arrow	move downward one position in the stack
up-arrow	move to top of stack
down-arrow	move to bottom of stack
CTRL  f		flip
CTRL  d		delete
CTRL  k		clone
CTRL  x		rotate clockwise 
CTRL  z		rotate counter-clockwise
CTRL  s		rotate TCA clockwise
CTRL  a		rotate TCA counter-clockwise
CTRL  c		conceal/unconceal (see CONCEALMENT)
CTRL  h		HIP/unHIP (see CONCEALMENT)
CTRL  b		CE/BU 
CTRL  l		change label.  To end, hit return
CTRL  i		displays Vehicle/Gun info (special ammo, etc.)	
CTRL  o		assume ownership (counter will be considered yours)

	Mac users can also use the Apple key instead of the CTRL.

	It is legal for you to manipulate counters belonging to your
opponent.  Honor system applies.

	Your own concealed units are drawn with a "?" in the upper
left corner.  Your opponent's concealed units look like dummies to
you.  Your own HIP units are drawn at smaller-than-normal size against
a white background.  Your opponent's HIP units are invisible to you.
